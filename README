This tool uses Python's difflib to generate diffs and allow for merges between
strings (not files!).

The difference between this and most tools is that the text and the diffs do
not have to be files in a filesystem! It allows for, say, the storage of diffs
in a database, to be pulled out and applied dynamically within your program. No
files need to be created or deleted, and no physical repository need exist on
the server.

I created this tool to help out with another project (author_collab), but given
its clear use cases, I thought I would keep it separate and allow anyone to use
this as a package. I am open to code contributions from others.

If you make use of this, let me know!
